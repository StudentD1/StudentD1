      <p align="center">About Mariana:</p>
	  <p align="center">I’m moving on to my senior year at Lockport Township High School where I’m involved in the </p>
	  <p align="center">Spanish Honor Society, National Honor Society, Interact Club, and Math Team. In my free time, I</p>
	  <p align="center">enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading, and playing Badminton. I try to be </p>
	  <p align="center">involved in my community as much as I can through volunteering. During the school year, I tutor</p>
	  <p align="center">at my church every Friday and also partake in volunteering events my school’s Interact Club</p>
	  <p align="center">hosts. Furthermore, I am very grateful for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program </p>
	  <p align="center">because thanks to the program, I am certain that I want to study Computer Science in college.</p>
	  <p align="center">Finally, in the fall of 2017, I plan on attending Lewis University and obtaining a major in</p>
	  <p align="center">Computer Engineering and a Double Minor in Ethnic and Cultural Studies and Spanish.</p>

	  <p align="center">About Destiny:</p>
	  <p align="center">I’m currently going into my junior year at Lindblom Math and Science Academy. I’m involved in </p>
	  <p align="center">many different clubs in and outside of school; I’m currently the co-captain for our Girl’s Rugby</p>
	  <p align="center">Team, I participate in our Learn to Read club, I’ve volunteered in many different soup kitchen </p>
	  <p align="center">through the years also. Participating in Girl’s Who Code has given me the opportunity to expand</p>
	  <p align="center">my knowledge in computer science and experience something new.</p>

	  <p align="center">About Karla:</p>
	  <p align="center">I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco before I immigrated to the U.S at a very young age and lived</p>
	  <p align="center">most of my life in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago. I am the second of four children in my family. </p>
	  <p align="center">I am currently a Senior at Palatine High School taking a packed schedule of AP classes. I first</p>
	  <p align="center">heard about the Girls Who Code program through a girl I met at one of my other summer</p>
	  <p align="center">programs through an organization called National Hispanic Institute(NHI). At the time, she was </p>
	  <p align="center">starting her Girls Who Code program a few days after our NHI program ended. The more she told </p>
	  <p align="center">me about the program the more interested I was and I made sure I applied for the next summer </p>
	  <p align="center">program. Before I came into this program I didn’t know a thing about coding and this program has</p>
	  <p align="center">taught me all I know. I went from having zero experience in the field to being able to code a robot </p>
	  <p align="center">like Ari. In college, I plan to go into the STEM field and major in Computer Engineering and minor in computer programming.</p>
